Note: the input file you download will be different to mine ("input.txt" in this folder), but I included it here just in case you want to test the code without participating on Advent of Code.

### Part 1
Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
```
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```

In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

>This is essentially a [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) question.

### Part 2

Now find 3 numbers that makes the sum.
